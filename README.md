# wordsearch
A program that functions as a wordsearch builder

I hope to add more features such as:
  - A solver
  - Layered word generation

A few guiding points:
  -There are three arguements to the class:
    - "words", add your own list of words or leave as None
    - "difficulty", ranges from 1-10, with increasing chance of reversing of words, or leave as None
    - "dev", just a dev mode for my behalf, automatically adds 5 words "TESTING"
    
Feel free to contribute any feature to this, whether it's catching errors, fixing bugs or adding features I hope to implement in the list above!
